👋 Hi, I'm Hassan — a passionate Software Engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a deep interest in building smart, scalable, and efficient solutions.
💻 I enjoy working across the stack, but I have a growing focus on AI/ML and Python development. I bring a problem-solving mindset, solid foundations in programming (Java, Python), and a constant drive to learn and improve.
🚀 Currently, I'm expanding my skills through hands-on projects, contributing to open-source, and exploring ways to blend engineering principles with cutting-edge technology.

🛠️ Tech I work with:
Python • Java • JavaScript • HTML/CSS • Git • VS Code • Jupyter • Linux

📚 Always learning something new — whether it's building APIs, training ML models, or exploring new frameworks.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to check out my repos or reach out for collaboration.
